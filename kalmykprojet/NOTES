The ability to load the comments for a article via AJAX

(you can manually trigger AJAX -Client Side logic model - Generic) 


But for this project I used Remote True:
Ask the server for what to do via AJAX - Server Side Ajax Model - REMOTE TRUE - Only in Rails

a. Bind a generic AJAX Request for more instructions to the click event (asking the server for JS)
b. Have the server render some JS as a response.
c. The Browser (jQuery) will execute the JS Response.



j method - action view method, to make a valid javascript
var html = "<ol>\n <li>comment<\/li>\n ......<ol>"

we set javascript variable equal some erb
we want to render this partial
that has all that html
this html needs to be escaped

that takes all this html as an argument
to generate whole snippet of html by using render action view
to render this partial
then html passed to j method that basically escapes that html to make a valid javascript
then we just want to append html - .html(html)

rails added remote true to link ---data-remote="true"----
<a class="load_comments" data-remote="true" href="/articles/1/comments">Load Comments</a>
that automatically
adds generic handler
followed ajax request to this url that jus automatically triggers this index.js.erb
and this view has all logic of what to do whenever someone click on this link
