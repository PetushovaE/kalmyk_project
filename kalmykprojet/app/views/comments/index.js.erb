var html = "<%=j(render('comments/comments'))%>"

$("div.comments").html(html)

// j method - action view method, to make a valid javascript
// var html = "<ol>\n <li>comment<\/li>\n ......<ol>"

// we set javascript variable equal some erb
// we want to render this partial
// that has all that html
// this html needs to be escaped

// that takes all this html as an argument
// to generate whole snippet of html by using render action view
// to render this partial
// then html passed to j method that basically escapes that html to make a valid javascript

// then we just want to append html - .html(html)
